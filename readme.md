## About The Project

This project involves creating a website for a Cruise Liner company that offers an online booking system. The website will be developed using JavaScript and jQuery for functionality. It will also demonstrate version control using Git and incorporate an API to enhance the user experience. Users will be able to book cruise trips and view journey details through an online web form. The project requires designing the website's aesthetics using HTML and CSS and implementing functionality with jQuery.

## Getting Started


To start developing your Cruise Liner company's online booking system website locally, ensure you have Git installed. Clone the project repository using 'git clone <repository_url>' in your terminal. If you need an API, secure the credentials. Customize HTML and CSS for your design, integrate functionality with jQuery, and test it locally. Maintain version control with Git by committing changes. If you're using an API, handle calls and responses. Thoroughly test the entire website, and if desired, deploy it using hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify. This approach lets you develop, test, and potentially deploy your website efficiently.
